set daemon  60

## Set syslog logging with the 'daemon' facility. If the FACILITY option is
## omited, monit will use 'user' facility by default. You can specify the
## path to the file for monit native logging.
#
#set logfile syslog facility log_daemon 
set logfile /var/log/monit.log

set mailserver localhost               # 

## By default monit will drop the event alert, in the case that there is no
## mailserver available. In the case that you want to keep the events for
## later delivery retry, you can use the EVENTQUEUE statement. The base
## directory where undelivered events will be stored is specified by the
## BASEDIR option. You can limit the maximal queue size using the SLOTS
## option (if omited then the queue is limited just by the backend filesystem).
#
# set eventqueue
#     basedir /var/monit  # set the base directory where events will be stored
#     slots 100           # optionaly limit the queue size

#set alert sw@underground8.com                            # receive all alerts
set alert limesas-alert@underground8.com { timeout }     # receive all alerts

set httpd port 2812 and
     use address localhost  # only accept connection from localhost
     allow localhost        # allow localhost to connect to the server and
     allow admin:loltruck2000      # require user 'admin' with password 'monit'
