Installing the Open AS Communication Gateway in 5 easy Steps
============================================================

Since the Open AS Communication Gateway is an entire Operating System, you will
need to set up a dedicated server for it. 


Quick install instructions:

1. Set up a new Ubuntu Server Lucid 10.04[.1] (VM recommended) with SSH.
   For productive use, the System will need at least 1 GiB of RAM. You may
   assign as many virtual cores/CPUs as you like, the system will use them
   all.
   Note: You may choose any username you like, except "limes" for it is
         reserved.

2. Install bzr, get a branch of the OpenAS project, and cd to that directory.
   Become root ("$ sudo su <RETURN>"):
    # aptitude update && aptitude install bzr
    # bzr branch lp:open-as-cgw
    # cd open-as-cgw

3. Start build-, packaging- and installation-process:
    # make

   Note: This process may take some time, depending on your machine and network
         connectivity (on a Core2Duo VM with 8Mbit Download, about 13 minutes).

(4. Network settings, optional)
  Edit /etc/limes/xml/system.xml, and adjust XML nodes <_net_interface> and
  <_net_dns>. These settings will be automatically set upon rebooting (next
  step). Normally, these settings are set solely via the WebGUI.

5. Reboot your machine


Viola, your brand-new Open AS Communication Gateway is ready. Open your
favourite browser, and log in to https://<ip>:980, username "admin", password
"password".
Note: By default, SSH only listens on port 2200/tcp.
