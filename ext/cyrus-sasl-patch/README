In order to provide a proxying mechanism to SASL-authenticated users, it's
necessary to patch saslauthd. The patch basically consists of adding one
authentication MECHANISM to saslauthd which, in turn, just calls a Perl
script which determines if the authentication was successful.

The patch has been ported to a couple of new versions of cyrus-sasl, and
is currently known to successfully patch cyrus-sasl v2.1.23 (which is,
at the time of this release, the current stable version, 2.1.24 is still
in RC status).

The original sources can be obtained from:
ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/cyrus-sasl-2.1.23.tar.gz

Moreover, there is a build.sh script, which automatically retrieves the
source, patches it, configures it, and build it. However, it does not check
if you have installed all necessary stuff in order to get a successful
build.

Packages needed in order to build the stuff:
dpatch automake1.9 libtool libdb4.8-dev libmysqlclient-dev libopie-dev libpq-dev libkrb5-dev libsqlite0-dev libldap2-dev chrpath docbook-to-man hardening-wrapper quilt
